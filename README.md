### Description

This is a free web app aimed at students that allows users to measure and track the amount of carbon dioxide emissions they do not produce when carpooling. It also allows the users to create private/public events and invite people with cars to find the most efficient way (in terms of the least amount of carbon dioxide emissions) to pick up the most amount of people. It is beneficial enviromentally and financially, especially for commuters who want to carpool with classmates in the area and do not want to spend money on a car service.
